For using the "Proxjoy" code, dataset must have certain columns from left to right:
Column "um" = this column contains the grainsize diameter particle range. 
Then, columns corresponding to each sample, for wich the column titles must contain the depth of the sample

Example:
um | -125 SAMPLE 1  | -130 SAMPLE 2 |  and so and so..

Tip:
If you are working on an excel sheet, beware of typing ' before the minus (-) and the depth value, so that you have no problem with excel 
thinking that you´re trying to type a formula.

You can look at the "ProxJoy_EXAMPLE.cvs"  file, attached to the main menú.

Have a nice coding :)
